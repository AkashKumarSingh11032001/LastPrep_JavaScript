1. Primitive vs Non-primitive dataype (differ by memory allocation)
    : Primitive DT (call by value)
        string
        number
        Boolean 
        null
        undefined
        symbol
        bigint
    : Reference DT/ Non-Primitive (call by reference)
        array
        object
        function

2. JS is Dynamic type or Static type?
    : JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means that the interpreter assigns a type to a variable based on its value at runtime.

3. typeof(null)?
    : object

4. typeof(function)?
    : object function

5. Stack vs Heap memory
    : Stack (all primitive type use stack) / call by value
      Heap (all Non primitive type use heap) / call by reference
      
6. value of math.pie === 3.14? can we round of to 4?
